# 🎙️ Python Voice Assistant

## 📌 Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a **Python-based voice assistant** that can listen to user voice commands, convert speech into text, respond using text-to-speech, and perform basic tasks such as greeting the user, announcing the current date and time, searching the web, and exiting on command.

## 🧩 Steps Performed
1. Imported required Python libraries for speech recognition, text-to-speech, web browsing, and date-time handling.  
2. Initialized the text-to-speech engine and configured voice properties such as speed and volume.  
3. Captured audio input from the microphone using the Speech Recognition library.  
4. Converted the captured speech into text using Google Speech Recognition.  
5. Processed user commands using conditional logic.  
6. Generated voice responses using the text-to-speech engine.  
7. Implemented Google search functionality using voice input.  
8. Added exception handling for unrecognized speech and network errors.  
9. Executed the assistant in a continuous loop until an exit command is given.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Speech Recognition:** `speech_recognition` (Google Speech API)  
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** `pyttsx3`  
- **Web Access:** `webbrowser`  
- **Date & Time Handling:** `datetime`  
- **Hardware:** Microphone

## ✅ Outcome
- Successfully developed a functional **voice-controlled assistant** using Python.  
- The assistant accurately listens to voice commands and responds using natural speech.  
- Basic tasks such as greeting, date and time retrieval, and web search are performed effectively.  
- The project demonstrates practical implementation of **Speech-to-Text** and **Text-to-Speech** technologies.
